            <h2>Where can you find more resources about sourdough?</h2>

            <p>
                There are tons of online resources that have more information regarding the science, art, and craft of
                sourdough. While there was always a sourdough following online, the COVID-19 pandemic really kickstarted
                the "trend" of sourdough on social media. People loved making the bread for two reasons: it was a way to
                bake without store-bought yeast (as it was in scarcity in some areas) and sourdough is really good! I've
                made a small list of my favorite bakers, articles, and more below.

            <h3>Claire Saffitz</h3>
            <p>
                Claire is sort of a phenom in the online baking world. Working as a test cook for Bon Appetit, she 
                quickly rose in popularity when her company started posting online cooking tutorials. Although she was
                well known for her exquisite baking skills, she showed off her versitlity cooking dishes like Steamed
                Pork Buns and Lousiana BBQ Ribs. She also partook in a massively popular series hosted by Bon Appetit,
                where she would try and recreate popular snacks and candy (such as Pocky, StarBursts, PizzaBagels, etc.).
                After the scandal that took place mid-2020 for Bon Appetit, Claie split with the company and pursued a solo
                career. Now with a successful cookbook launch, an appearance on late-night television, and her own YouTube
                channel, Claire teaches others who just have their appartment kitchens how to make all kinds of desserts 
                with ease.

            <h3>Online groups</h3>
            <p>
                Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Discord can be great places to discover other bakers who are 
                figuring out the same problems you have. You can also find out interesting tips and hacks that have 
                worked for others to make the baking process even more expidited. Social media is also just a great 
                place to socialize and make new baking friends in general! A few online groups are linked below.
