            <h2>What's the science behind the starter?</h2>

            <p>
                From the homepage, we now know that a sourdough starter is made up of a mixture of flour, water, and 
                (most importantly) the culture of yeast microorganisms. But how does this turn a bowl of wet flour into 
                a delicious loaf of bread?

                Well, first let's start with how the microorganisms make their way into the starter. Both the flour and 
                our air naturally contain these yeast and bacteria, but they can't break down our flour without a little
                help. When water is added into the flour, it kickstarts an enzyme called amylase. Amylase breaks down 
                the starch of the flour into two sugars: glucose and maltose. These are sugars that our natural yeast 
                can metabolize and digest! With time, the yeast from the air and flour and feed on the sugars from the 
                starter and multiply, developing a stable culture. The yeast produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct to all
                this digesting, which is the gas that makes our bread rise in the oven.

                But what about the unique "sour" flavor that sourdough has? Well, that comes from a process known as 
                fermentation. Along with the yeast in the starter, there's also a specific type of bacteria known as 
                lactic acid. Lactic acid converts the sugars in the flour mixture into alcohol, which gives the bread
                its unique "sour" taste once it's baked.
