                Sourdough is a unique kind of bread because of its leavening agent. While some breads add in store-bought 
                yeast, sourdough relies on a "starter" made of a mixture of flour, water, and wild yeast from the air
                in a person's kitchen. This starter is then fermented for days to weeks before being used as the yeast in 
                the bread dough. The long period of fermentation imparts a sour flavor that's different from other kinds 
                of bread. Extra lactic acid, the chemical produced during the fermentation process, also means sourdough 
                keeps better than other kinds of bread.
                <br>
                One of the draws to sourdough making has been how different the bread can be with changes to the starter.
                Because everyone's cooking environments are different, the air has different amounts of natural yeast. Natural
                yeast is just a certain type of fungi that floats around in the air. These yeast particles combine with a
                baker's mixture of flour and water to start a starter culture.

                The difference in the type and amount of yeast in different baker's environments mean that sourdough can 
                come out with completely different tastes and textures between a bakery in New York and one in LA. These large
                differences have led some bakers to take to social media and trade their sourdough starters so they can taste
                the differences between different starters.
